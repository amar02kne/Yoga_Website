      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">This is an amazing one for beginners as it gives one the desired comfort.
        The
        asana is beyond the horizons of the physical dimension and gives a spiritual bliss. <strong>Sukhasana is best
          to reduce
          anxiety and stress and mental tiredness</strong> . It corrects the body posture and stretches the chest and
        spine.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Tip:</strong> Sit with the legs tucked inside the opposite thighs and the spine should be vertically
        straight. The hands
        should be placed on the knees and breathe in and out gently.

          muscles and
          it improves digestion and reduces belly fat.</strong> It is good to improve the efficiency of abdominal
        muscles.<br><br>

        <strong>Tip:</strong> One needs to lie on one’s back with legs together and the hands-on the thighs, without
        touching them. Then
        the body should make a 30-degree angle.

        <strong>Tip:</strong> One needs to make a posture like a steady stance by placing the right foot high up on
        the left thigh and
        the hands should be over the head with the palms together. The spine must be straight and the sole of the foot
        flat and firm. After releasing the pose, one needs to change the position and try the other leg.

        sluggishness and enhance mental and physical balance, kakasana is the best option, as it stretches the muscles
        of arms, wrists, and forearms.<strong>The posture makes the body and mind feel light. It brings together the
          scattered
          mind.</strong> It is difficult to perform and takes a lot of practices.<br><br>

        <strong>Tip:</strong> One needs to squat and keep the legs slightly apart with the hands firmly on the floor.
        After that, the
        body should be uplifted and the hands on the floor.

        The curve structure of the asana massages the deep back muscles, spine and nerves. <strong>It can be a great
          asana for
          people dealing with arthritis of the lower back and lower back pains. It relieves menstrual
          problems</strong> by
        stretching the uterus and ovaries. It releases stress through invigorating adrenal glands and kidneys.<br><br>

        <strong>Tip:</strong> After lying on the floor on the stomach, the hands should be on the floor after the
        upper body should be
        stretched and uplifted.

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The halasana opens up the spinal disc and aims to keep the spinal system
        youthful as it stretches the spinal muscles. The stretch releases the tension from the shoulders, arms and
        spine. <strong>It is one of the best asanas to tackle obesity. By revitalising the internal organs, it can
          cure
          indigestion and constipation and neck arthritis stiffness.</strong><br><br>

        <strong>Tip:</strong> Begin with lying on your back with the hands-on each side should be straight and

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The meaning of Sarvangasana is “all parts”. The asana involves the entire
        body
        and revitalises it. It involves the thyroid gland and stimulates metabolism, protein synthesis, and blood
        circulation. The posture of the asana strengthens muscles and lowers the chances of kidney and bone
        disease.<strong>It
          aims to reduce insomnia, depression and mental anxiety.</strong> <br><br>

        <strong>Tip:</strong> As the name suggests, one needs to stand on the shoulder.

      <p class="secTag text-big">Shirsasana Or Headstand</p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Shirsasana aka “the king of the asanas” is one of the most difficult asanas
        but has remarkable benefits. It <strong>improves blood circulation, gives strength to the respiratory system,
          improves
          concentration and memory.</strong> The asana involves the brain, spine and entire nervous system and
        stimulates the
        pituitary and pineal glands. The upside-down pose helps to ease constipation and relieves nervous disorders
        and
        anxiety.<br><br>

        <strong>Tip:</strong> Take the support of a wall, to begin with. Keep the spine straight with your head down
        and feet up. Use
        your hands to support yourself.
